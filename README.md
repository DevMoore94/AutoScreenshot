# AutoScreenshot
Java project that takes a screenshot and auto saves it to a folder and opens that folder.

## Executing

1. Clone project and import it into eclipse.
2. Build project with gradle.
3. Build the Jar with Gradle.
4. Create "screenshots" folder on the root of the C drive.
5. Copy Jar from build/libs folder to the screenshots folder

**I personally link the .jar file to one of my keyboards extra keys to execute it.
